    Well I did not got to dialysis today. Since I am no longer working I have managed to totally mess up my sleep schedule and I slept through my alarm. Today is Monday so tonight I will study some code, and the rest of this week I will devote two hours a day or more to learning. I need to call my local college and see what needs to be done to get me back in school. I need to reschedule my eye appointment with a retina specialist. I just need to stop missing appointments and take better care of myself. That's why I am in the situation I am now. I have never really taken care of myself. My mom has had two procedures in two weeks and I complain because of my every other day life saving treatment. I need to watch my fluids and go on home dialysis. I really need to get some things fixed so I can try and get another job because disability is going to pay me shit. Its basically being part time and making minimum wage in my state. You cannot make it on that amount. I don't know how people on SSI make it, but I just have to hold out until I can get back to work. I am praying and hoping that this is temporary for me and I will be back on feet in no time. I still have big dreams, just have to work harder and sacrifice a little more to get there. Can't expect things to happen if I'm not doing anything to make those things happen.

    I announced my shirts and sold one so far. Not sure anyone is going to contribute. It was an idea though. I hope I can get back on track with learning coding and maybe start making some websites for people. I need to come up with some other ideas for shirts. I think a catchy slogan can get some sold to friends. Momma hired a handy man to do our yard and gutters. Great job so far. I think moms going to ask him if he can do our bathroom. So everyone knows, my mother lives with me. It's a bit of drag I know, but she's my mom and she raised me. She can be a bit of a pain, and overly dramatic, but she means well. I made a plan to lose weight and watch mu fluids, but as of now I am not doing so well with. Wish me luck. Email me with any shirt ideas for kidney disease, funny is preferable and I don't get offended

    I haven't posted in the last two weeks, that's on me. I haven't keep up with my training and I have felt bad, on and off anyway. I ordered some of my Smart Ass White Boy shirts from my teespring account. If you want a shirt, helps support my kidney fund, <a href="https://davids-teespring-store.creator-spring.com/listing/sawb2">smart ass tee</a> then follow this link to buy your own. I am a little nervous that no one will buy one, but if they don't, it's no great lose to me. I need to continue learning coding so I can try and do some side work to get experience before I get back into the job market. I hope that in the next month or so I can start losing weight and get some things fixed so I can get back to being a productive member of society. I hate to be stuck on disability for the rest of my life.
    <br>
    I understand that there are those out there who need it, they can't work because of an issue, and I understand. I just don't want that to be me. I hope one day I will have me some acres somewhere in the middle of nowhere with a tiny home, a four wheeler, and great internet speeds. One can dream can't they.
    <br>
    I have also  been playing Red Dead Redemption 2 on the ps4 the last two weeks. It has taken a lot of my time. I don't play games that often anymore, but when I find one I like I play it until its done. I am almost finished with the game now, but I usually do a second play through to get achievements. Anyone out there have any game or movie suggestions for me. Just things that you have enjoyed and think others might, let me know by email

  Happy Independence Day America.  I don't get all teary eyed over much but when I hear the Star Spangled Banner I do get a little misty eyed. It's okay to love your country, and since we are in America I guess it's okay if you don't. Freedom, am I right? I'm going to start updating this blog weekly on Sunday and I figured why not start today. Not much to say today. It has been a rough dialysis week. I got some books sorted to start reading. So hopefully my HTML and CSS will turn into JavaScript and more in the coming moths. Anyone have any suggestions on books or videos I should watch to help me out? If you do its appreciated. Thanks, and happy 4th.

    Had dialysis today, sucked as always. Tried some JavaScript gaming code from a YouTube video, didn't work out like I planned. Think I am missing something. I will try again tomorrow. This is a rough month for me. The month my Grandma passed, also the month my step dad passed. He left on July 4th 2008, Lung cancer. Devastated my mom. Now she is back with her loser ex husband, sort of. It's a long story that I will save for a rainy day if anyone ever wants to hear it. Anyway, Its almost Independence Day here in America. Anyone got any good plans to do anything fun. I don't, just gonna be at home and try to feel better and hopefully have some energy. This has to be the worse part of kidney disease. Literally feeling like you ran a marathon as soon as you walk 30 foot, but when you're sitting you feel like you have energy, try and get up and move and feel like falling. That's my experience anyway. Oh well, on to more coding training videos. Thinking about maybe 30 minutes to an hour a day for now so I don't get burnt out, already feel overwhelmed with massive amount of paths you can take and things you can learn. How do you decide? Do you try to be a master at some, or just basic understanding of it all? I don't know, but it sure is interesting and exciting to think about.

    It has been a rough few years. I found out I have kidney disease due to a medical mistake from 2016. They said my kidney function would return, but it got worse. I am now on dialysis. I also have Charcot Arthropathy, which causes softening of the bones in the ankle. With that said, my career path in nursing was kinda put on hold. I am currently trying to fix my foot and get on the kidney transplant list. It is easier said than done as you have to meet certain requirements that I, as of now, have not. At the moment I am out of work, it was hard to work anyway with a foot that hurts to walk on and having zero energy from low hemoglobin with dialysis. It really sucks not being healthy like I used to be. I guess I have always been over weight, but until I got kidney disease things were looking up. I had a great career, I was losing weight, and it seemed that my future was bright. Then I started having less energy, I started gaining weight again. I finally went back to my doctors and got the bad news about my kidneys.
    <br> <br>
    Life goes on though. I got a kid to support and when I get healthy again I would like to have money and a job, so I started looking into computer science. My goal is to start with web design, maybe some app and game work and move on to software engineering and penetration testing. Its a long road, but I love computers and learning about this stuff fascinates me. I should have stuck with computers when I was in school, but I didn't listen to myself. I listened to others instead of following my own dreams. I can't complain though, the road I took got me my son. If I would have followed a different path I might not have him, and he is what keeps me going. I am hoping to get back in school this fall for web development so I can start making some money again. That's why I started this blog, so I can be held accountable for the things I need to do. Some motivation if you will. I look forward to hearing criticism and suggestions from any and everyone. I am going to publish this to GitHub for the moment until I can spring for a website and hosting.
    <br> <br>
    Look for this blog to change over the coming months as I learn more about web design and more. I hope to update weekly, but you can email me any time and I will reply as soon as I can. Please be critical and make suggestions if you want. You can't hurt my feelings so let it fly.
