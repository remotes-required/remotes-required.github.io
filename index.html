     <p>Well it's been quite a while since I posted anything, and I plan to post more in the near future. I have had some set backs, i lost my left leg below the knee due to a bad infection from a disease 
       called Charcot Arthropathy. I have been stuck in a wheel chair due to fall and busting my staples, but it seems I am finally ready to start working on a prosthetic solution and start walking again. 
       I cannot wait.

     <p>Oh what a week it has been. DJ got sick and didn't go to work, got him to the doctor on Monday, they tested for covid and should have results tomorrow. Hopefully DJ still has a job.
       Tristan went back to his dad's Friday so he could see his girlfriend. Haven't heard from him yet. Biden has really messed up these last seven months in office, I don't think he is pulling 
       the strings. Inflation is high, we lost Afghanistan, gas is high, unemployment is on the rise, America is back to America last again. I miss Trump. He was a real leader, not scared to let 
       people know we wouldn't stand for being used. These liberal, democrats, leftist, whatever you want to call them are just a bunch of hurt feelings and my opinion matters more than fact 
       kinda losers. I can get along with you no matter your politics, race, religion, whatever, but I can't deal with stupid. Anyway. Still trying to learn about coding. Decided to good at front 
       end end and try and get a job while still learning. Hopefully this time next year I will be able too. Don't think disability is going to suit me, but with my medical problems I need to 
       get right before I can go back to a job. My charcot foot hurts bad on and off, and wearing the boot and compression socks seem to help. I have an appointment with the endocrinologist Friday, 
       hopefully get my sugar back under control. Need to get with my primary and my eye doctor for follow ups. My dialysis is going okay, I still have trouble with my fluids. It's so hard not to drink. 
       I stay thirsty and I've always been able to drink what I want so it's hard. I go through phases where I do good and then I don't. I am going to start exercising a little and see how that 
       helps my hemoglobin and my energy levels. Speaking of hemoglobin I need to get with a hematologist about my low hemoglobin. I really think a lot of it has to do with my foot, but I don't 
       know for sure. My goals are still the same for now. Hopefully I will be doing freelance WordPress by the end of the month. That will give me some items in my portfolio for when I try for a job. 
       I also have one or two app ideas, but I don't wish to share them at this time. I wrote a letter to my best friend, he's in prison. He's been there since the same month I found out about my kidney 
       disease, June 2019. Damn time has gone by quickly. I thought I was finally getting my shit together and then boom, I was hit with that devastating news. Oh well, bad things happen. Just have 
       to soldier on and make things work. Don't forget to email me questions or topics to talk about.

   <p>My boy Tristan came over today. He said he's going to stay the rest of the week with us. He was supposed to go see his girlfriend today and have a date. Ice cream and a walk on the Lake Lure 
     beach. His mom told him no. She tried to call me but didn't leave a message and didn't answer when I called back. Katie's shirt came in today so I will head up to my brothers this weekend to 
     drop them off. I hope they like them. I need to sell some. People lied when they said they would buy them, now I have shirts in sizes I can't wear. Oh well. The stock isn't going anywhere and
     people may eventually buy them. I tell you I feel god awful today. Just so slow and sluggish. Heavy I would even say. Like my arms and legs are too heavy to carry. I would make a joke at that 
     about me me being overweight if it weren't so true. I am going to try to study some tonight and maybe sort my new books into there permanent home.

    <p>So it's been a week. I have had arguments with my mom about her ex husband being here all the time. I can't stand him. He has been a drunk all my life, Always starting fights with all of us, treating her like shit, he left as soon as he got his disability and was able to afford his own place, he left the day he did because my mom told him no more alcohol, he says awful things about the people who treat him the best, and he's just an awful person. So my mom says she told him she doesn't want anymore to do with him because I'm always complaining about him and now she says she's alone and blame's me. Typical for my mom. I love her, but that's one way her and her ex are alike, they blame everyone else for their problems and choices. I don't know what to do here, but I am sure she will be seeing him still, another way they are alike, they lie. I love my mom, but she is who she is, and she has stopped seeing him before and that never worked out. On a better note my son is enjoying his job. He gets up on his own and gets ready without being told. He's becoming responsible and I love that. I need to get my foot done and get back right so I can get a job and get away from here. Leave my mom this house and find me and DJ somewhere else to go. Make better money so I can take care of her and let her be who she is where I don't have to be around her choices. I gotta get off here for now, this is depressing

   <h1><u><b>August 13th 2021</b></u></h1>
   <p>A few things have happened in the last two weeks. I am finally getting back to learning HTML from the Udemy course I bought, but I am starting to understand that I should use the free stuff on YouTube first. The same course I paid 10 bucks for is on YouTube for free. I am not mad or upset because I didn't know and I am still new to this, but seeing as I only paid 10 dollars it's not a big deal. Bigger news, DJ got a job at our local grocery store. He starts tomorrow. I opened him up a bank account, and opened one for Mom as well. I like my bank and hope they enjoy it too. DJ has also started back in school. 10th grade, hard to believe. I just wish he would work harder to get his permit. He has failed the written test three times, but it's not the same test it was when I was his age. They ask you about points and other parts of driving, not actually driving. He'll get there I am sure. I am going to watch some YouTube videos on how to get started doing web dev on FiveR to make some much needed extra cash. I haven't done anything as far as rescheduling my eye doc appointment. I really should get on that. I am trying to be more active and drink less as well so I can lose some weight. So far I haven't lost an, but I have been successful with not gaining any extra fluid. At least that what it looks like when I weigh for Dialysis. Hopefully going to organize a little better this weekend, and if anyone wants SAWB shirts I will travel to Chester to sell them on Sunday. So far no buyers except Little Mike, my brother. DJ loves his that I gave him. He has worn it on several occasions. I bought him some school shorts off of amazon and I will need to send them back for a bigger pair. I need to lose weight to set an example for my son, get better and show him that I have only kept to myself because of how I have felt. I used to be a lot more active and wish to be that way again. I also need to call my local college on Monday to see about getting into some classes. I really want to get my associates degree at least. Maybe then I can get a better paying job once I can start work again. Then I'll look into furthering my career in computer science. Making apps, Video games, and Software sounds so cool. I just hope I can learn it and use it to turn my life around

    Well I did not got to dialysis today. Since I am no longer working I have managed to totally mess up my sleep schedule and I slept through my alarm. Today is Monday so tonight I will study some code, and the rest of this week I will devote two hours a day or more to learning. I need to call my local college and see what needs to be done to get me back in school. I need to reschedule my eye appointment with a retina specialist. I just need to stop missing appointments and take better care of myself. That's why I am in the situation I am now. I have never really taken care of myself. My mom has had two procedures in two weeks and I complain because of my every other day life saving treatment. I need to watch my fluids and go on home dialysis. I really need to get some things fixed so I can try and get another job because disability is going to pay me shit. Its basically being part time and making minimum wage in my state. You cannot make it on that amount. I don't know how people on SSI make it, but I just have to hold out until I can get back to work. I am praying and hoping that this is temporary for me and I will be back on feet in no time. I still have big dreams, just have to work harder and sacrifice a little more to get there. Can't expect things to happen if I'm not doing anything to make those things happen.

    <h1> <u><b>July 26th 2021</b></u></h1>
    I announced my shirts and sold one so far. Not sure anyone is going to contribute. It was an idea though. I hope I can get back on track with learning coding and maybe start making some websites for people. I need to come up with some other ideas for shirts. I think a catchy slogan can get some sold to friends. Momma hired a handy man to do our yard and gutters. Great job so far. I think moms going to ask him if he can do our bathroom. So everyone knows, my mother lives with me. It's a bit of drag I know, but she's my mom and she raised me. She can be a bit of a pain, and overly dramatic, but she means well. I made a plan to lose weight and watch mu fluids, but as of now I am not doing so well with. Wish me luck. Email me with any shirt ideas for kidney disease, funny is preferable and I don't get offended

    I haven't posted in the last two weeks, that's on me. I haven't keep up with my training and I have felt bad, on and off anyway. I ordered some of my Smart Ass White Boy shirts from my teespring account. If you want a shirt, helps support my kidney fund, <a href="https://davids-teespring-store.creator-spring.com/listing/sawb2">smart ass tee</a> then follow this link to buy your own. I am a little nervous that no one will buy one, but if they don't, it's no great lose to me. I need to continue learning coding so I can try and do some side work to get experience before I get back into the job market. I hope that in the next month or so I can start losing weight and get some things fixed so I can get back to being a productive member of society. I hate to be stuck on disability for the rest of my life.
    <br>
    I understand that there are those out there who need it, they can't work because of an issue, and I understand. I just don't want that to be me. I hope one day I will have me some acres somewhere in the middle of nowhere with a tiny home, a four wheeler, and great internet speeds. One can dream can't they.
    <br>
    I have also  been playing Red Dead Redemption 2 on the ps4 the last two weeks. It has taken a lot of my time. I don't play games that often anymore, but when I find one I like I play it until its done. I am almost finished with the game now, but I usually do a second play through to get achievements. Anyone out there have any game or movie suggestions for me. Just things that you have enjoyed and think others might, let me know by email

  Happy Independence Day America.  I don't get all teary eyed over much but when I hear the Star Spangled Banner I do get a little misty eyed. It's okay to love your country, and since we are in America I guess it's okay if you don't. Freedom, am I right? I'm going to start updating this blog weekly on Sunday and I figured why not start today. Not much to say today. It has been a rough dialysis week. I got some books sorted to start reading. So hopefully my HTML and CSS will turn into JavaScript and more in the coming moths. Anyone have any suggestions on books or videos I should watch to help me out? If you do its appreciated. Thanks, and happy 4th.

    Had dialysis today, sucked as always. Tried some JavaScript gaming code from a YouTube video, didn't work out like I planned. Think I am missing something. I will try again tomorrow. This is a rough month for me. The month my Grandma passed, also the month my step dad passed. He left on July 4th 2008, Lung cancer. Devastated my mom. Now she is back with her loser ex husband, sort of. It's a long story that I will save for a rainy day if anyone ever wants to hear it. Anyway, Its almost Independence Day here in America. Anyone got any good plans to do anything fun. I don't, just gonna be at home and try to feel better and hopefully have some energy. This has to be the worse part of kidney disease. Literally feeling like you ran a marathon as soon as you walk 30 foot, but when you're sitting you feel like you have energy, try and get up and move and feel like falling. That's my experience anyway. Oh well, on to more coding training videos. Thinking about maybe 30 minutes to an hour a day for now so I don't get burnt out, already feel overwhelmed with massive amount of paths you can take and things you can learn. How do you decide? Do you try to be a master at some, or just basic understanding of it all? I don't know, but it sure is interesting and exciting to think about.

    <h1> <u><b>July 1st 2021</b></u></h1>
    It has been a rough few years. I found out I have kidney disease due to a medical mistake from 2016. They said my kidney function would return, but it got worse. I am now on dialysis. I also have Charcot Arthropathy, which causes softening of the bones in the ankle. With that said, my career path in nursing was kinda put on hold. I am currently trying to fix my foot and get on the kidney transplant list. It is easier said than done as you have to meet certain requirements that I, as of now, have not. At the moment I am out of work, it was hard to work anyway with a foot that hurts to walk on and having zero energy from low hemoglobin with dialysis. It really sucks not being healthy like I used to be. I guess I have always been over weight, but until I got kidney disease things were looking up. I had a great career, I was losing weight, and it seemed that my future was bright. Then I started having less energy, I started gaining weight again. I finally went back to my doctors and got the bad news about my kidneys.
    <br> <br>
    Life goes on though. I got a kid to support and when I get healthy again I would like to have money and a job, so I started looking into computer science. My goal is to start with web design, maybe some app and game work and move on to software engineering and penetration testing. Its a long road, but I love computers and learning about this stuff fascinates me. I should have stuck with computers when I was in school, but I didn't listen to myself. I listened to others instead of following my own dreams. I can't complain though, the road I took got me my son. If I would have followed a different path I might not have him, and he is what keeps me going. I am hoping to get back in school this fall for web development so I can start making some money again. That's why I started this blog, so I can be held accountable for the things I need to do. Some motivation if you will. I look forward to hearing criticism and suggestions from any and everyone. I am going to publish this to GitHub for the moment until I can spring for a website and hosting.
    <br> <br>
    Look for this blog to change over the coming months as I learn more about web design and more. I hope to update weekly, but you can email me any time and I will reply as soon as I can. Please be critical and make suggestions if you want. You can't hurt my feelings so let it fly.
