    <h1> <u><b>July 1st 2021</b></u></h1>
    It has been a rough few years. I found out I have kidney disease due to a medical mistake from 2016. They said my kidney function would return, but it got worse. I am now on dialysis. I also have Charcot Arthropathy, which causes softening of the bones in the ankle. With that said, my career path in nursing was kinda put on hold. I am currently trying to fix my foot and get on the kidney transplant list. It is easier said than done as you have to meet certain requirements that I, as of now, have not. At the moment I am out of work, it was hard to work anyway with a foot that hurts to walk on and having zero energy from low hemoglobin with dialysis. It really sucks not being healthy like I used to be. I guess I have always been over weight, but until I got kidney disease things were looking up. I had a great career, I was losing weight, and it seemed that my future was bright. Then I started having less energy, I started gaining weight again. I finally went back to my doctors and got the bad news about my kidneys.

    Life goes on though. I got a kid to support and when I get healthy again I would like to have money and a job, so I started looking into computer science. My goal is to start with web design, maybe some app and game work and move on to software engineering and penetration testing. Its a long road, but I love computers and learning about this stuff fascinates me. I should have stuck with computers when I was in school, but I didn't listen to myself. I listened to others instead of following my own dreams. I can't complain though, the road I took got me my son. If I would have followed a different path I might not have him, and he is what keeps me going. I am hoping to get back in school this fall for web development so I can start making some money again. That's why I started this blog, so I can be held accountable for the things I need to do. Some motivation if you will. I look forward to hearing criticism and suggestions from any and everyone. I am going to publish this to GitHub for the moment until I can spring for a website and hosting.
    <br> <br>
    Look for this blog to change over the coming months as I learn more about web design and more. I hope to update weekly, but you can email me any time and I will reply as soon as I can. Please be critical and make suggestions if you want. You can't hurt my feelings so let it fly.
